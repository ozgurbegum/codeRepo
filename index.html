<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href>Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
JS is the best

<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

Not much!
<ul>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ul>
